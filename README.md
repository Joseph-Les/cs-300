CS-300 DSA: Analysis and Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course, my key objective was to determine the most efficient data structure for processing and organizing a dataset of courses and their prerequisites. The challenge involved efficiently sorting and storing course data from an input file.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To address this problem, I developed pseudocode for each considered data structure, analyzing their performance through algorithms. This approach was crucial to understand the importance of data structures in optimizing operations like sorting and data retrieval.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Throughout the project, I relied heavily on class materials and external research to tackle challenges. Writing pseudocode was instrumental in clarifying necessary steps and facilitating the transition of these concepts to practical implementation in C++, a language less familiar to me compared to others.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project underscored the importance of thorough research before coding. Previously, I often commenced coding with the first solution that came to mind. Now, I recognize the value of researching, reading, and testing to find the most suitable solution for each project.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My experience with this project has reinforced the significance of object-oriented programming. I focused on enhancing the program's modularity, ensuring that it is maintainable, readable, and easily adaptable by facilitating the seamless integration or removal of individual classes. This approach not only aids in readability but also ensures ease of future updates.
